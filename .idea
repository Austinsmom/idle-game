#idle game
=========

  1. idle game where game is played in years

rather than waiting for time to pass, you pick your configuration for the year and run the next year

the idea is to take the idle element out while keeping the gameplay experience mostly unchanged

game still starts idle but can optionally become non idle?

at the beginning:
  you increment the amount of time passing (micro, mili, sec, min, hour, day, week, month, year, decade, century)

  as the time increment scale changes, the matter scale changes as well (particles, bacteria, insects, small animals, humans, countries, aliens, galaxies, universes)

  game can auto increment if desired, auto increment time can be adjusted on demand to slow/speed the flow of time

  the goal of the game is to reach the end as efficiently as possible

  stats persist as the player continues playing,

  game could have high score board, since the game rewards being more efficient in a different way

  in normal idle games, you are rewarded for being efficient by reaching the end of the game faster

  in this game, reaching the end faster and more efficiently means a higher score




should refactor the code base with new features in mind

One of the core gameplay features should be adjusting the flow of time

can be similar to diablo where first few playthroughs are introductory, and features are added until you reach the core game, when it becomes competitive

Game should contain multiple instances of incrementals, these are known as 'worlds', these increase in scale as you complete more of them

Game also contains a ui for controlling the flow of time.  At first this is unavailable, but more features of this ui are unlocked as worlds increase in scale



World Scale (similar to scale of matter)

These have a meta game similar to matter of scale where instances start slow to complete but recieve upgrades that improve their speed and boost higher up worlds

Each world should have a different tech tree to keep things interesting

each world has a different gameplay mechanic to master to get through it quickly

if you understand the strategy, the phase should be much, much shorter

particles - unique gameplay: none (all are gained manually)
bacteria - unique gameplay: resource producing units
fish - unique gameplay: breeding (make profit by producing producing units [swarm simulator, shark game]) this replaces autobuy
apes - unique gameplay: crafting
humans - unique gameplay: war (make profit by producing military units to take land)
villages - unique gameplay: religion (make profit by buying high and selling low)
towns - unique gameplay: trading (make profit by buying high and selling low)
cities - unique gameplay: industry (automated crafting)
planets - unique gameplay: space travel (travel to different planets for bonuses based on number of planets)
galaxies - unique gameplay: time control (speed up time based on number of galaxies)
universes - unique gameplay: paragon/prestiege (start over with bonuses based on number of universes)

Time Scale

As world scale is increasing, time scale increases as well, at first only microseconds are passing and there is no control

time starts at a fixed speed, but can then be adjusted to any desired speed in a threshold that increases as the world scale increases

react-bootstrap
react-motion

Need to limit the amount of instances that can be created
should also limit the amount of work that lower level properties do later on
can simplify stats and just have them produce research that can be converted to other things
should be able to catch up between sessions by computing missing ticks

Can use ideas from kittens game
Have trading as a mid-late game element
Have long craft trees for later game elements
