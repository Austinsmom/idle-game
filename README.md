# idle-game

This is an incremental / idle game based on [matter of scale](http://astarsearcher.com/)

It's implemented using mainly react and redux but also makes use of redux-persist for localStorage saving and bootstrap for style

## Getting Started

  1. You start with a single Hamlet and Bloodhound which will accumulate Deer once per tick

  2. Use the accumulated Deer to buy more deer producing assets

  3. Profit!

## More Details

  You can click the "Get Upgrades" button for some points towards bonus multipliers on buildings.   Once the instance is completed, these upgrades are lost, but they help speed things up immensely.

  Once the goal for an instance is reached, it will be ready to be completed. this will be done automatically after about a minute, or as soon as you click the bar.

  Once you complete your first Hamlet, you will get a village, which is largely the same but with a bigger scale
  You will also get another Hamlet and some venison to improve your Hamlets.

  At this point, you want to speed to rate at which you can finish Hamlets so that you can get more Villages to get more wool.etc

  You can play all the way up to the scale of the universe!

  Different scales will eventually have different gameplay features to make progression more interesting.

  The current version is more a test of the implemetation of the stores.

  Currently does not tick while not in an active tab, but you can pull it into its own window to get around this for now.

## Misc

As much as I like matter of scale, the pacing is far too slow.  I also found the implemetation to be lack luster and wondered if I could do better
