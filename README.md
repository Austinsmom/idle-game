# idle-game

This is an incremental / idle game based on [matter of scale](http://astarsearcher.com/)

It's implemented using mainly react and redux but also makes use of lodash and updeep

## Getting Started

  1. You start with a single Hamlet and Bloodhound which will accumulate Deer once per tick

  2. Use the accumulated Deer to buy more deer producing assets

  3. Profit!

## More Details

  Once the goal for an instance is reached, it will be ready to be completed

  this will be done automatically after about a minute, or as soon as you do it manually

  Once you complete your first Hamlet, you will get a village, which is largely the same but with a bigger scale
  You will also get another Hamlet and some venison to improve your Hamlets with

  At this point, you want to speed to rate at which you can finish Hamlets so that you can get more Villages to get more wool.etc

  You can play all the way up to the scale of the universe!

  Different scales will eventually have different gameplay features to make progression more interesting

  The current version is more a test of the implemetation of several complex data structures

## Other stuff

As much as I like matter of scale, the pacing is far too slow, and the implemetation is very, very messy
